# Note
Worlds worst note taking system :)

# Inspiration
if you don't care about where, how, who, what, why, or when your notes program is, and just want a simple folder of notes, this is the project for you.


# Included
- script for math notes in typst (helix handles zathura and compilation using tinymist)
- script for just notes in markdown (no preview)
- script for overviewing notes (notes)
- script for overviewing math notes (mnotes)

# Configuration
Since these scripts are "stupid", use env vars:

```bash
# use your shell config, .profile, or whatever to set your editor
EDITOR="hx"
# alias for specific persistent notes (E.G. a todo note)
alias todo='note todo'
# that's it. You can stop reading now.
```

# Scope
Anything that fits in the bash script, my usecase is already covered
